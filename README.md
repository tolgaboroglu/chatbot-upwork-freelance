# Custom AI Chatbot Project Demo

This project was carried out with the aim of collecting and processing information from case files and training it with the Bert Turkish model. This allows users to access information about their cases more quickly and efficiently, as well as obtain up-to-date information about the current status of the cases instantly. The basic steps of the study are detailed below:

1. **Data Collection and Processing:** Text data from case files was collected and cleaned. During this stage, unnecessary information was filtered out and the texts were processed in the appropriate format.

2. **Model Training:** The Bert Turkish model was trained with the collected and processed data. In this process, special training was provided to adapt the model to legal terminology and case processes.

3. **Chatbot Integration:** The trained Bert Turkish model was integrated into a chatbot platform. This chatbot was optimized to understand and respond to user questions.

4. **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface was designed. Through this interface, users can ask questions related to case files to the chatbot and receive immediate responses.

5. **Real-Time Updates:** The chatbot tracks updates in case files and provides real-time information. This ensures that users always have up-to-date information about the status of their cases.

As a result, this project enables users to manage their case processes more effectively and access information quickly. This reduces the workload, allowing for more efficient work.
