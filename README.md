# Lawyer Support Chatbot Project Demo

This project was carried out with the aim of collecting and processing information from a lawyer's case files and training it with the Bert Turkish model. This allows the lawyer to access information about their cases more quickly and efficiently, as well as obtain up-to-date information about the current status of the cases instantly. The basic steps of the study are detailed below:

1. **Data Collection and Processing:** Text data from case files was collected and cleaned. During this stage, unnecessary information was filtered out and the texts were processed in the appropriate format.

2. **Model Training:** The Bert Turkish model was trained with the collected and processed data. In this process, special training was provided to adapt the model to legal terminology and case processes.

3. **Chatbot Integration:** The trained Bert Turkish model was integrated into a chatbot platform. This chatbot was optimized to understand and respond to user questions.

4. **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface was designed for lawyers. Through this interface, lawyers can ask questions related to case files to the chatbot and receive immediate responses.

5. **Real-Time Updates:** The chatbot tracks updates in case files and provides real-time information to lawyers. This ensures that lawyers always have up-to-date information about the status of their cases.

As a result, this project enables lawyers to manage their case processes more effectively and access information quickly. This reduces the lawyers' workload, allowing them to work more efficiently.
